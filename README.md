To resolve this, we assume a set of prototype aspect terms represented by its sentiment prior distributions. We first observed the its sentiment prior distribution of each aspect terms in training set as shown in Table: \ref{Aspect-vector-representation}. Then we use K-means to classified the aspect vector into 3 cluster, each cluster represent a latent aspect term. We then joint training classification on both latent aspect terms and sentiment (GloVe-SA-LSTM-Kmeans3).  The experiments showed Accuracy and F1 are 60\% and 47.5\%.
