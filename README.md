1. Co-regularized Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [[Paper,NeurIPS2018]](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8146-co-regularized-alignment-for-unsupervised-domain-adaptation.pdf)

2. Strong Baselines for Neural Semi-supervised Learning under Domain Shift [[paper, ACL2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09530) [[code, dynet]](https://github.com/bplank/semi-supervised-baselines)

  >This paper reviews several neural bootstrapping methods like self-training, tri-training, tri-training with disgreement and proposed a multi-task tri-training (MT-Tri) model. The author applies the above methods on POS tagging (SANCL 2012) and Sentiment anlaysis(Amazon reviews) and shows that classic tri-training works the best and even outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method.

4. Word Translation Without Parallel Data [[Paper, ICLR2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04087) [[code,pytorch]](https://github.com/balasrini32/CSE293_NLP) [[code,pytorch]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE)
  > The word translations with parallel data boils down to the Procrustes problems. One can learn the mapping W with SVD. However, to find the word translations without parallel data is difficult. This paper proposed a domain-adversarial approach  (Adv) for learning W. The model contains a discriminator to discriminate between elements randomly sampled from WX (X is source, Y is target). To produce reliable matching pairs between two languages, the paper use cross-domain simiarity local scaling (CSLS) instead of nearest neighbors. The unspervision method with Adv shows comparable result with supervison method.
